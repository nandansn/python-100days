## tkinter - canvas

### canvas - widget

- canvas, drawing one component on top of another, like writing the text on over image
- use Photoimage class to read the image file
- use create_image() method to add the photo image variable to set the image
- use create_text() method to add the text on image
- then pack the canvas

### dynamic typing:

- But Python is a dynamically typed language. It doesnâ€™t know about the type of the variable until the code is run. So declaration is of no use. What it does is, It stores that value at some memory location and then binds that variable name to that memory container. And makes the contents of the container accessible through that variable name. So the data type does not matter. As it will get to know the type of the value at run-time.
