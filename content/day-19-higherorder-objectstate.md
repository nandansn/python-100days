## Higher order function,

- function that takes another function as an input, this is like call back function
> def a():
>   do_something

> def higher_order_fun(fun):
>   fun()

> higher_order_fun(a)

- this is extensively used in gui programs, like listening to the event and act or do stuff accordingly
