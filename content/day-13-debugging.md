## Debugging

- discovering the bug.
### 1. Describe the problem
- here you should really understand the problem
- what the logic is trying to solve
- what are the values assigned
- what is the assumption
- etc...

### 2. Reproduce the bug
- if the error is consistent then it will be easy to re-produce
- if the error is random, then we need to analyse deeply to figure out the error condition

### 3. Play computer
- evaluate the program line by line
- follow the logic and analyse it
-  basically we need to act like the computer

### 4. Fix the errors
- when the editor highlights the error, fix it
- when there is error in the console, copy the error and check it in the stackoverflow

### 5. squash the bug with print statement
- use the print statement to display the output for the statement that produces the value or result out of some operation

### 6. Use debugger:
- use the debugger option in the vs code
- use the online debugger,
