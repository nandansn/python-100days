## OOPS

### How to use classes and objects?

- class is a design map for the object
- when you are designing the class/object
	- need to know what it has
	- need to know what it does
  - Example: when you are designing car object
	  - attributes
		  - car has engine,
	      - car has tyres
    - methods
	      - car does move front
	      - car does move back

## constructing the object and accessing the attributes

- class
- class name is pascal case
- no new keyword here

## module in python
- python file is a module
- to access the variable or method, you need to **import** the module
- if you want to impor the specific method or variable then
	- from module_name import method_name 


## python package

- bunch of module/files packaged
- Where to find the packages already created,
- [Ref] (https://pypi.org/)
- The Python Package Index (PyPI) is a repository of software for the Python programming language.
- How to use the package?
	- you need to refer the documentation and implement it.
