## CSV Data Library

### Pandas

-  the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis/manipulation tool available in any language.

### pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data:

- Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet

- Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.

- Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels

- Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure
