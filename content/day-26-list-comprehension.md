## List comprehenson

- List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.

### The Syntax

> newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]

- **Condition** The condition is like a filter that only accepts the items that valuate to True.

- **Iterable** The iterable can be any iterable object, like a list, tuple, set etc.

- **Expression** The expression is the current item in the iteration, but it is also the outcome, which you can manipulate before it ends up like a list item in the new list
