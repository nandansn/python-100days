## Scope

- where you define your variable or function
- local and global scope
- local variable or function can be deined and accessed within the wall or the space
- global variable or function can be defined and accessed outside the wall or space
- there is no block scope in python

## Defining constants
- use global variables as global constants
- **Note:** In reality, we don't use constants in Python. Naming them in all capital letters is a convention to separate them from variables, however, it does not actually prevent reassignment.
