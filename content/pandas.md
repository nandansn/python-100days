## Pandas

**Pandas well suited for:**
- Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet

- Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.

- Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels

- Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure

**Data Structures**

- The two primary data structures of pandas, Series (1-dimensional) and DataFrame (2-dimensional), handle the vast majority of typical use cases in finance, statistics, social science, and many areas of engineering.
